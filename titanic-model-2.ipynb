This seems like an extension of Pclass, but if so, why is the correlation reduced by roughly 8%? Perhaps it is thrown off by the crew that did not pay for the voyage?

From the occupants that are known, it seems that many of these particular occupants were unwilling to leave, either due to disbelief, fear of leaving the ship, or guilt at its sinking, rather than being willfully excluded from lifeboats.\n\nDecks B and C https://titanic.fandom.com/wiki/B_Deck#:~:text=B%20Deck%2C%20also%20called%20the,featuring%20their%20own%20private%20promenades., https://titanic.fandom.com/wiki/C_Deck ), have a much higher proportion of known occupants than any other decks, so we can have a higher certainty that these proportions are fairly accurate.\n\nG and F decks were entirely third class passengers and both of these decks were completely flooded within minutes of hitting the iceberg. Since there were 1,100 third class passengers, it appears that both G and F were full of Unknown status passengers.\n\nInterestingly, E deck, despite being fairly low in the ship, had a comparatively high survival rate. Whether or not it played a part is uncertain, but we can note that a majority of the onboard crew were cabined on E deck (https://titanic.fandom.com/wiki/E_Deck ). It is possible that, despite a comparatively low status, their position of power on the ship afforded them a better chance of surviving.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sex_survival = titanic_data.groupby(['Sex'])['Survived'].value_counts().unstack().plot(figsize=(10, 8), kind='bar',stacked = False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-10T05:13:21.800123Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-10T05:13:21.800555Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-10T05:13:22.092613Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-10T05:13:21.800526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-10T05:13:22.091645Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The difference between the survivorship of the sexes is highly significant, though unsurprising.

The facts of the night make it clear, though, that this is not the only reason, as many third class passengers were denied access to lifeboats.\n\nWe may have a better approximation of the true significance by examining the difference between first and second class passengers, who were both on sections that flooded more slowly.
