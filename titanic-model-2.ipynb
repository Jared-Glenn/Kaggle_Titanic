This seems like an extension of Pclass, but if so, why is the correlation reduced by roughly 8%? Perhaps it is thrown off by the crew that did not pay for the voyage?

Since there were 1,100 third class passengers, it appears that both G and F were full of Unknown status passengers.\n\nInterestingly, E deck, despite being fairly low in the ship, had a comparatively high survival rate. Whether or not it played a part is uncertain, but we can note that a majority of the onboard crew were cabined on E deck (https://titanic.fandom.com/wiki/E_Deck ).

The facts of the night make it clear, though, that this is not the only reason, as many third class passengers were denied access to lifeboats.\n\nWe may have a better approximation of the true significance by examining the difference between first and second class passengers, who were both on sections that flooded more slowly.
